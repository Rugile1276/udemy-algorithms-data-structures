## Problem solving patterns

1. Frequency Counter
  Uses objects or sets to collect VALUE and its FREQUNCIES.
  It helps to avoid nested loops or O(n^2) operations with arrays or string.
  E.g.:
  ```javascript
  ['accbacc'] => obj = {'a' : 2, 'b': 1, 'c': 4};
  ```
2. Multiple Pointers
3. Sliding Window
